== About me
I am currently pursuing my M.Sc. degree in control science and engineering with the School of Automation at Guangdong University of Technology and supervised by Prof. [https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37536009300 Yong Xu]. My previous research focuses on finite-, fixed-, and predefined-time consensus for multiagent systems via discontinuous control, with potential applications in formation control as well as attitude synchronization. I serve as a reviewer for /Automatica/ and /Neurocomputing/. 

I am now seeking a Ph.D. position for Fall 2023!
