== About me

I am currently pursuing my M.Sc. degree in control science and engineering with the School of Automation, Guangdong University of Technology, advised by Prof. [https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37536009300 Yong Xu]. I serve as reviewer for /Automatica/ and /Neurocomputing/. My research focuses on fixed-time consensus for multi-agent systems via discontinuous control, with applications in formation control as well as attitude synchronization. I am now seeking a Ph.D. position in multiagent systems theory for Fall 2023.
